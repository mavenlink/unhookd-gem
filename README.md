# unhookd-gem

This gem allows you to send a request to the Unhookd service in a Kubernetes cluster to deploy a rails application with a given sha and chart

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage
```
# Configure unhookd
Unhookd.configure do |config|
  config.unhookd_url = "your-url-to-your-unhookd-installation"
  config.chart_name = "your-chart-repo/your-chart-name"
  config.repo_name = "your-git-repository"
end

# Call deploy with the correct args!
Unhookd.deploy!("your-branch", "your-sha", { "some_value" => "you'd like to set on your chart" })
```
